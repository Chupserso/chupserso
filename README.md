Good afternoon.
My name is Yevhen, I'm 17 years old and I'm from Kyiv. I've been doing web development since I was 14 years old, mostly as a freelancer. My main focus is front-end, I know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, I also have experience with Node.js, Express, worked with REST API, Git, Redux, React Router, Tailwind, and other technologies.

On freelance basis, I developed custom websites: both in PHP and WordPress, and in React with a Node.js backend.
In addition, he created several pet projects, such as an online business card platform, a movie search app, and an app with natural sounds for focusing.
